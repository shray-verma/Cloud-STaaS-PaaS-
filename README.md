# PrivateDock-Cloud

This project is all about the formation of cloud over the RedHat Entreprise linux version 7 (RHEL 7 ) to provide the services like SaaS (Software as a service), STaaS ( Storage as a service), and OSaaS ( Operating System as a service ).

PrivateDock is a application designed for providing the cloud services to the users. It includes cloud services, SaaS (Software as a Service), STaaS (Storage as a Service), and OSaaS (Operating System as a Service). This application provides a GUI interface to the user presenting a list of software available to choose from. This software service is a kind of Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. The user can select the software of his/her choice and directly uses the software as if it is installed on his own system but actually not. In reality, the software application runs on the server but provide the graphical window on the client’s system so the client can interact with it. 

The idea behind creating this GUI application is that the user don’t have to purchase any of proprietary software licenses for using it, they can use our “PrivateDock” app through which they can access the software of their choice without paying any licensing fee. They just pay for the time duration they have used the software. Also the user can switch between the different computers as the services are accessed through an account, not by the software alone. The client have to first login into the “ PrivateDock ” application and use the software registered on his account. This allows the client to use his software from anywhere and anytime.

This application also includes one more cloud service called STaaS (Storage as a Service). The user having an account on PrivateDock is provided with a cloud storage for managing the user’s files as well as that created using the software.

Docker is implemented for providing OSaaS (Operating System as a Service), and because of it's ability to use containers it will require less time for creating instances of an operating system.
